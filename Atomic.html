                    well go ahead and get yourself a File Manager i sugest<a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/mit">Geofilza</a>,
                    Then head to Var and LIB. If you dont have this then go and make sure you have jailbrocken your device.
                    Then come back and you should see this folder has been added. Then go ahead and download the tweak by heading to this link
										which gives you a variety of ios 12 tweaks that have been tested
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    You will then need to copy and paste the files into the correct folders. e.g mobile substate files go into the mobile substrate folder.
                    Once all the files are in the correct ones, reboot device, rejailbreak and your done :)
