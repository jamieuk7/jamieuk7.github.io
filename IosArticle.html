                <h5 class="card-title">iPhone X(s)</h5><p class="lead font-weight-normal text-muted"></p>
                  <p>Apple is expected to unveil three new iPhones! each with the iPhone X design including Face ID and no bezels. An updated 5.8-inch OLED version of the iPhone X is expected to come in around $899 ($100 cheaper this year), a massive 6.5-inch OLED version is expected to start around $999 and serve as the ‘Plus’ version, and a cheaper 6.1-inch LCD version with multiple color options is expected to replace the entry level side of the flagship lineup.

                    Notice the gold in the announcement art? This year the iPhone X is expected to come in gold — don’t hold your breath for a round Apple Watch (or iPhone!) though.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">iPad Pro</h5><p class="lead font-weight-normal text-muted"></p>
              <p>If we see new iPads unveiled at the event, we expect to see two iPad Pro upgrades with Face ID and no Home button. (Personally, I don’t expect a notch either given the size of the slim bezels on the iPad anyway.) The new models should include an 11-inch version, up from 10.5-inches, and a 12.9-inch version.</p>

              <p>The big rumor for the Apple Watch Series 4 (if that’s what Apple calls it) is a new design focused on increasing the screen size — possibly without increasing the overall casing. The new watch may also have solid state buttons and improved heart rate detection.</p>

              <p>In addition to new iPhones and Apple Watches, it’s highly likely we’ll finally hear more about AirPower, Apple’s wireless charging mat that was previewed last September. We should also learn more about the AirPods charging case that works with AirPower, and maybe even see a new version of AirPods that features built-in “Hey Siri” recognition.

               <br> We should also learn when Apple plans to release iOS 12, watchOS 5, and tvOS 12. macOS Mojave is also still in beta, but Mac software updates are sometimes scheduled later. Other surprises may be in store, so stay tuned to 9to5Mac for full details going into the event!</p>
